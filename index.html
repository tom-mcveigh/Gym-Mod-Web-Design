			<hr>
			<p><strong>Bottlenose dolphins</strong>, the genus <strong><i class="taxonomy">Tursiops</i></strong>, are the most common members of the family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphinidae" title="Delphinidae">Delphinidae</a>, the family of oceanic dolphin. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology" title="Molecular studies">Molecular studies</a> show the genus contains three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="species">species:</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bottlenose_dolphin" title="common bottlenose dolphin">common bottlenose dolphin</a> (<i class="taximony">Tursiops truncatus</i>), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pacific_bottlenose_dolphin" title="Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin">Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin</a> (<i class="taximony">Tursiops aduncus</i>), and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrunan_dolphin" title="Burrunan dolphin">Burrunan dolphin</a> (<i class="taximony">Tursiops australis</i>). Bottlenose dolphins inhabit warm and temperate seas worldwide, being found everywhere except for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circle" title="Antarctic Circle">Antarctic Circle</a> regions.</p>
			
			<p>Bottlenose dolphins live in groups typically of 10â€“30 members, called pods, but group size varies from single individuals up to more than 1,000. Their diets consist mainly of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forage_fish" title="forage fish">forage fish</a>. Dolphins often work as a team to harvest fish <ahref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoaling_and_schooling" title="schools">schools</a>, but they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_echolocation" title="echolocation">echolocation</a>, which is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar" title="sonar">sonar</a>. They emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echos to determine the location and shape of nearby items, including potential prey. Bottlenose dolphins also use sound for communication, including squeaks and whistles, as well as sounds emitted through body movements, such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the water surface.</p>
			
			<p>Numerous investigations of bottlenose dolphin intelligence have been conducted, examining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry" title="mimicry">mimicry</a>, use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_language" title="artificial language">artificial language</a>, object categorization, and self-recognition. They can use tools (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponges" title="sponging">sponging</a>) and transmit cultural knowledge across generations, and their considerable intelligence has driven interaction with humans. Bottlenose dolphins gained popularity from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarium" title="aquarium">aquarium</a> shows and television programs such as <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipper_(1964_TV_series)" title="Flipper (1964 TV series)">Flipper</a></i>. They have also been trained by militaries to locate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_mine" title="sea mines">sea mines</a> or detect and mark enemy divers. In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape. Some encounters with humans are harmful to the dolphins: people hunt them for food, and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean_bycatch" title="bycatch of tuna">bycatch of tuna</a> fishing and by getting caught in <a href="crab traps" title="crab traps">crab traps</a>.</p>
			
			<p>The deepest dive ever recorded for a bottlenose dolphin was 300 meters (990 feet). This was accomplished by Tuffy, a dolphin trained by the US Navy.</p>
			
			<p>Nellie, the longest-lived Atlantic bottlenose dolphin in human care, died at age 61 on April 30th 2014. Nellie was born on Feb, 27, 1953 at Marineland.</p>
			
			<p>Bottlenose dolphins have the second largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalization" title="encephalization">encephalization</a> levels of any mammal on Earth (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human" title="humans">humans</a> have the largest), sharing close ratios with those of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human" title="humans">humans</a> and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_apes" title="great apes">great apes</a>, which more than likely contributes to their incredibly high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence" title="intelligence">intelligence</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_quotient" title="emotional intelligence">emotional intelligence</a>.</p>
