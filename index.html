			<h1>Bottlenose dolphin</h1>
			<hr>
			<p><strong>Bottlenose dolphins</strong>, the genus <strong><i class="taxonomy">Tursiops</i></strong>, are the most common members of the family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphinidae" title="Delphinidae">Delphinidae</a>, the family of oceanic dolphin. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology" title="Molecular studies">Molecular studies</a> show the genus contains three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="species">species:</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bottlenose_dolphin" title="common bottlenose dolphin">common bottlenose dolphin</a> (<i class="taximony">Tursiops truncatus</i>), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pacific_bottlenose_dolphin" title="Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin">Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin</a> (<i class="taximony">Tursiops aduncus</i>), and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrunan_dolphin" title="Burrunan dolphin">Burrunan dolphin</a> (<i class="taximony">Tursiops australis</i>). Bottlenose dolphins inhabit warm and temperate seas worldwide, being found everywhere except for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circle" title="Antarctic Circle">Antarctic Circle</a> regions.</p>
			
			<p>Bottlenose dolphins live in groups typically of 10â€“30 members, called pods, but group size varies from single individuals up to more than 1,000. Their diets consist mainly of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forage_fish" title="forage fish">forage fish</a>. Dolphins often work as a team to harvest fish <ahref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoaling_and_schooling" title="schools">schools</a>, but they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_echolocation" title="echolocation">echolocation</a>, which is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar" title="sonar">sonar</a>. They emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echos to determine the location and shape of nearby items, including potential prey. Bottlenose dolphins also use sound for communication, including squeaks and whistles, as well as sounds emitted through body movements, such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the water surface.</p>
			
			<p>Numerous investigations of bottlenose dolphin intelligence have been conducted, examining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry" title="mimicry">mimicry</a>, use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_language" title="artificial language">artificial language</a>, object categorization, and self-recognition. They can use tools (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponges" title="sponging">sponging</a>) and transmit cultural knowledge across generations, and their considerable intelligence has driven interaction with humans. Bottlenose dolphins gained popularity from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarium" title="aquarium">aquarium</a> shows and television programs such as <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipper_(1964_TV_series)" title="Flipper (1964 TV series)">Flipper</a></i>. They have also been trained by militaries to locate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_mine" title="sea mines">sea mines</a> or detect and mark enemy divers. In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape. Some encounters with humans are harmful to the dolphins: people hunt them for food, and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean_bycatch" title="bycatch of tuna">bycatch of tuna</a> fishing and by getting caught in <a href="crab traps" title="crab traps">crab traps</a>.</p>
			
			<p>The deepest dive ever recorded for a bottlenose dolphin was 300 meters (990 feet). This was accomplished by Tuffy, a dolphin trained by the US Navy.</p>
			
			<p>Nellie, the longest-lived Atlantic bottlenose dolphin in human care, died at age 61 on April 30th 2014. Nellie was born on Feb, 27, 1953 at Marineland.</p>
			
			<p>Bottlenose dolphins have the second largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalization" title="encephalization">encephalization</a> levels of any mammal on Earth (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human" title="humans">humans</a> have the largest), sharing close ratios with those of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human" title="humans">humans</a> and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_apes" title="great apes">great apes</a>, which more than likely contributes to their incredibly high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence" title="intelligence">intelligence</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_quotient" title="emotional intelligence">emotional intelligence</a>.</p>
			
			<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
			
			<p>Scientists were long aware that <i class="taxonomy">Tursiops</i> dolphins might consist of more than one species. Molecular genetics allowed much greater insight into this previously intractable problem. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="IUCN">IUCN</a> acknowledges two species,[10] although a third distinct species was described in 2011: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bottlenose_dolphin" title="Common bottlenose dolphin">the common bottlenose dolphin</a> (<i class="taxonomy">T. truncatus</i>) is found in most tropical to temperate oceans, and it has a grey color, with the shade of grey varying among populations, but it can be bluish-grey, brownish-grey, or even nearly black, and is often darker on the back from the rostrum to behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_fin" title="dorsal fin">dorsal fin</a>;[11] the Black Sea bottlenose dolphin (<i class="taxonomy">T. t. ponticus</i>), a subspecies of <i class="taxonomy">T. truncatus</i> lives in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>;[12][13] The Pacific bottlenose dolphin (T. gillii or T. t. gillii), another subspecies of T. truncatus, lives in the Pacific, and has a black line from the eye to the forehead;[14][15] the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (T. aduncus) lives in the waters around India, northern Australia, South China, the Red Sea, and the eastern coast of Africa, with the back being dark-grey and the belly being lighter grey or nearly white with grey spots;[16] the Burrunan dolphin (T. australis), found in the Port Phillip and Gippsland Lakes areas of Victoria, Australia, was described in September 2011 after research showed it was distinct from T. truncatus and T. aduncus, but is not considered a separate species by the IUCN.
				<p>The two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecotype" title="ecotypes">ecotypes</a> of the common bottlenose dolphin within the western North Atlantic[18] are represented by the shallower water or coastal ecotype and the more offshore ecotype.[18] Their ranges overlap, but they have been shown to be genetically distinct.[18] They are not currently described, however, as separate species or subspecies. In general, genetic variation between populations is significant, even among nearby populations.[11] As a result of this genetic variation, other distinct species currently considered to be populations of common bottlenose dolphin are possible.</p>
				
				<p>Old scientific data do not distinguish between the two species, making it useless for determining structural differences between them. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN">IUCN</a> lists both species as data deficient on their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_List" title="Red List">Red List</a> of endangered species because of this issue.</p>
				
				<p>Some recent genetic evidence suggests the Indo-Pacific bottlenose belongs in the genus <i class="taxonomy"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenella" title=Stenella>Stenella</a></i>, since it is more like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_spotted_dolphin" title="Atlantic spotted dolphin">Atlantic spotted dolphin</a> (<i class="taxonomy">Stenella frontalis</i>) than the common bottlenose.</p>
				
				<h3>Hybrids</h3>
				
				<p>Bottlenose dolphins have been known to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="hybridize">hybridize</a> with other dolphin species. Hybrids with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risso%27s_dolphin" title="Risso's dolphin">Risso's dolphin</a> occur both in the wild and in captivity.[22][23] The best known is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolphin" title="wolphin">wolphin</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_killer_whale" title="false killer whale">false killer whale</a>-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. The wolphin is fertile, and two currently live at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii. The first was born in 1985 to a female bottlenose. Wolphins also exist in the wild.[24] In captivity, a bottlenose dolphin and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough-toothed_dolphin" title="rough-toothed dolphin">rough-toothed dolphin</a> hybridized.[25] A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_dolphin" title="common dolphin">common dolphin</a>-bottlenose dolphin hybrid born in captivity lives at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SeaWorld_San_Diego" title="SeaWorld">SeaWorld</a> California.[26][27] Other hybrids live in captivity around the world and in the wild, such as a bottlenose dolphin-Atlantic spotted dolphin hybrid.</p>
				
				<h2>Description</h2>
				
				<hr>
				
				<p>Bottlenose dolphins are grey, varying from dark grey at the top near the dorsal fin to very light grey and almost white at the underside. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countershading" title="countershading">countershading</a> makes them hard to see, both from above and below, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_locomotion" title="swimming">swimming</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult" title="Adults">Adults</a> range from 2 to 4 metres (6.6 to 13.1 ft), and 150 to 650 kilograms (330 to 1,430 lb).[29] Males are, on average, slightly longer and considerably heavier than females. In most parts of the world, the adults are about 2.5 m (8.2 ft), and 200 to 300 kilograms (440 to 660 lb).[11] Their size varies considerably with habitat. Except in the eastern Pacific, dolphins in warmer, shallower waters tend to be smaller than those in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooler" title="cooler">cooler</a>, <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagic" title="pelagic">pelagic</a> waters.[1]</p>
				
				<p>Bottlenose dolphins can live for more than 40 years. Females typically live 5-10 years longer than males, with some females exceeding 60 years.[30][31][32] This extreme age is rare and less than 2% of all Bottlenose dolphins will live longer than 60 years.[33] Bottlenose Dolphin can jump at a height of 6 meters (20 feet) up in the air; they use this to communicate with one another.[34]</p>
				
				<h2>Anatomy</h2>
				
				<hr>
				
				<p>Their elongated upper and lower jaws form what is called a rostrum, or snout, which gives the animal its common name.[35] The real, functional nose is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowhole_(bio)" title="blowhole">blowhole</a> on top of its head; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_septum" title="nasal septum">nasal septum</a> is visible when the blowhole is open.[30]</p>
				
				<p>Bottlenose dolphins have 18 to 28 conical teeth on each side of each jaw.[30][35]</p>
				
				<p>The flukes (lobes of the tail) and dorsal fin are formed of dense <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue" title="connective tissue">connective tissue</a> and do not contain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone" title="bone">bone</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle" title="muscle">muscle</a>. The dorsal fin usually shows phenotypic variations that help discriminate among populations.[36] The animal propels itself by moving the flukes up and down. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectoral_fin" title="pectoral flippers">pectoral flippers</a> (at the sides of the body) are for steering; they contain bones <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)" title="homologous">homologous</a> to the forelimbs of land mammals. A bottlenose dolphin discovered in Japan has two additional pectoral fins, or "hind legs", at the tail, about the size of a human's pair of hands. Scientists believe a mutation caused the ancient trait to reassert itself as a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atavism" title="atavism">atavism</a>.[37]</p>
