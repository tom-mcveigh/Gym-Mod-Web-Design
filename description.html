			<p>Bottlenose dolphins are grey, varying from dark grey at the top near the dorsal fin to very light grey and almost white at the underside. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countershading" title="countershading">countershading</a> makes them hard to see, both from above and below, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_locomotion" title="swimming">swimming</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult" title="Adults">Adults</a> range from 2 to 4 metres (6.6 to 13.1 ft), and 150 to 650 kilograms (330 to 1,430 lb).[29] Males are, on average, slightly longer and considerably heavier than females. In most parts of the world, the adults are about 2.5 m (8.2 ft), and 200 to 300 kilograms (440 to 660 lb).[11] Their size varies considerably with habitat. Except in the eastern Pacific, dolphins in warmer, shallower waters tend to be smaller than those in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooler" title="cooler">cooler</a>, <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagic" title="pelagic">pelagic</a> waters.[1]</p>
			
			<p>Bottlenose dolphins can live for more than 40 years. Females typically live 5-10 years longer than males, with some females exceeding 60 years.[30][31][32] This extreme age is rare and less than 2% of all Bottlenose dolphins will live longer than 60 years.[33] Bottlenose Dolphin can jump at a height of 6 meters (20 feet) up in the air; they use this to communicate with one another.[34]</p>
