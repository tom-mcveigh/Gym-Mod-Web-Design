			<h2>Anatomy of the Bottlenose Dolphin</h2>
			
			<p>Their elongated upper and lower jaws form what is called a rostrum, or snout, which gives the animal its common name.[35] The real, functional nose is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowhole_(bio)" title="blowhole">blowhole</a> on top of its head; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_septum" title="nasal septum">nasal septum</a> is visible when the blowhole is open.[30]</p>
			
			<p>Bottlenose dolphins have 18 to 28 conical teeth on each side of each jaw.[30][35]</p>
			
			<p>The flukes (lobes of the tail) and dorsal fin are formed of dense <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue" title="connective tissue">connective tissue</a> and do not contain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone" title="bone">bone</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle" title="muscle">muscle</a>. The dorsal fin usually shows phenotypic variations that help discriminate among populations.[36] The animal propels itself by moving the flukes up and down. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectoral_fin" title="pectoral flippers">pectoral flippers</a> (at the sides of the body) are for steering; they contain bones <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)" title="homologous">homologous</a> to the forelimbs of land mammals. A bottlenose dolphin discovered in Japan has two additional pectoral fins, or "hind legs", at the tail, about the size of a human's pair of hands. Scientists believe a mutation caused the ancient trait to reassert itself as a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atavism" title="atavism">atavism</a>.[37]</p>
